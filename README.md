# Project Title

## Overview
This Python script automates certain actions on a platform. It interacts with the platform's interface using PyAutoGUI to perform tasks such as clicking buttons, scrolling, and sending connection requests.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- PyAutoGUI library
- Images of UI elements for PyAutoGUI to locate

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:


## Usage
1. Ensure the images of UI elements are present in the "./image" directory.
2. Run the main_code.py script.
3. The script will start by sleeping for 2 seconds, then enter a loop to execute various functions based on the responses obtained from the platform.
4. The loop will continue until it successfully sends connection requests five times (count==5).
